  title: Reporting Anomalies
  author: me
  description: "There are four rooms, you just haven't reported a Camera Malfunction.\n\nDefuse
    a bomb while the anomalies are taking over your house, and remove them from existence.\n\nThere
    are many credits that I need to put but I'm about to play L4D2, so I'll do them
    later.\n\nThe manual can be found in the manuals folder of the game or at ktane.timwi.de.
    Press F5. A bunch.\n\nContact Fartlicker777#9169 on Discord if there are any bugs.\r"
